# particle-sound
Sound Visualization using particles in p5.js
- Takes sound in from the microphone, uses p5.js fft (fast fourier transform) functionality to convert the sound into an arbitrary energy
- This energy corresponds to animation on each particle randomly generated in the app
- The intensity of sound increases the volatility of each particle --> visualizes sound
- Can recognize direction as well
